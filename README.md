# Airline Reservation System

## Programming Language

The project is developed using the C++ programming language, incorporating the principles of object-oriented programming. The graphical user interface is implemented with C++ CLR Windows Form in Visual Studio, utilizing the .NET Framework. Additionally, the application manages user and flight reservation data through C++ file I/O handling.

## Project Description

The Airline Reservation System is a demonstration GUI application designed to facilitate the management of airline tickets. The primary goal of the application is to provide users with a convenient platform to book or cancel their airline reservations, eliminating the need to wait in long queues. The application allows users to input personal details such as name, email, debit/credit card information, CNIC, and passport number, which are then used in the ticket generation process.

After providing the necessary information, users can proceed to specify their flight preferences and request ticket generation. The system generates tickets based on user selections and booking information. Furthermore, users have the capability to cancel their booked tickets directly through the application.

## Features

- **User Details:** Collects essential personal information including name, email, and identification details for ticket generation.

- **Flight Preferences:** Allows users to specify their flight preferences, select seats, and request ticket generation.

- **Ticket Generation:** Generates tickets based on user selections and booking information.

- **Cancellation:** Provides a straightforward process for users to cancel their booked tickets.

- **Object-Oriented Approach:** Implements object-oriented programming concepts for efficient design and maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **C++:** Core logic and functionality of the Airline Reservation System are implemented in C++.

- **C++ CLR Windows Form:** Utilized for creating the graphical user interface in Visual Studio.

- **.NET Framework:** Provides the infrastructure for C++ CLR Windows Form application development.

- **File I/O Handling:** Manages user and flight reservation data through C++ file I/O operations.
